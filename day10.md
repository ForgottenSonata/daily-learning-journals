#Friday Day10 11/18/16

Github is being really difficult. Firstly, my files keep disappearing. To make matters worse my files keep changing locally with weird text on them that I did not submit.
 I am not sure what's going on with my OS but I am hoping by coming in today and by changing
 over to Ubuntu/Linux will help solve my problems!
