#Day 4 Thursday 11/10/16

When the day began, I was exhausted from a week filled with a ton of new information. I was worried about Wednesday's assignment on loops and arrays because I had a challenging time with it. 
However, I was SO relieved that Aaron spent time going over the assignment. Using a fellow student's assignment as an example helped to illustrate where I had made mistakes and I was able to finally start to 
understand the logic and concept of for/while loops and arrays. Also, I truly enjoyed the Pair Assignment. Not only was my partner (Brigitte) a pleasure to work with, but we both brought different strenghts to the table which helped us
be a beneficial team! I also realized it was the first time I talked through code with someone else at the same level.
talking through code together helped so much!
Overall, a great day and week!
