#Wednesday Day 3 Journal 11/9/16

Today was the most challenging day so far. I wasn't able to finish the assignment as I could not figure out 
the exact code in the seventh question. I need to spend time this weekend practicing for and while loops. 
Also I am a bit behind on the reading and discussion assignments so I am hoping to get all caught up this weekend to be able to 
start fresh next week and be as prepared as possible for the next steps.

I am grateful that my peers are so friendly and helpful and that both Stephanie and Johnny are more than willing to help out with anything.
Also, Aaron was so awesome and helpful in yesterday's lab and I really felt supported by everyone and that they want us all to succeeed!
