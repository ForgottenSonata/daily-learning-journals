#First Day of Class 11/07/16

Today was the first day of Code 201. The inital anxiety I had this morning has diminished slightly, but I'm still worried about this class being too challenging for me. I did learn that I am grasping and retaining the information more than I thought, but I also find myself focusing on the mistakes I've made. I am glad I am able to see what mistakes I made today (cloning the repository in the wrong directory) so I could ask for help, fix the mistakes and then be able to correct them for the future. I am relieved that today went well and I am feeling hopeful and optimistic about the outcomes of my work in this class. I really like the instructor who is very accessible and willing to be helpful to all students, as well as the T.A.'s. No one has made me feel inferior or lesser than, which is what I experienced in the past with instructors and peers at previous institutions. I look forward to the rest of this week, continuing to learn from the instuctor and my peers. I am excited about the course in general.
