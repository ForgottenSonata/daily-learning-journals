#Day 5 Learning Journal

So, I take some comfort in knowing that I'm not completely clueless to all the concepts/code we have learned so far. 
I have my strengths and weaknesses in different areas but I am really grateful we had the weekend to catch up and review. 
Since I am prone to self-depricating and I have a self-fulfilling prophecy that I will fail at everything I do. I hope to conquer that prophecy and succeed in this class and in programming in general.
